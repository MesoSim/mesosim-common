	could not get glyphicons inside buttons(pencil-new team, repeat-existing team)

NewTeam and ExistTeam.html
	Text above button?

CarSelection.html
	dropdown menu refuses to drop down...
	columns inside of the car options aren't working? I have no clue why...
	^^^ same issue on the TeamInfo.html page
  
IinitialPosition.html
  doesn't suck that bad?
  
Chase.html
